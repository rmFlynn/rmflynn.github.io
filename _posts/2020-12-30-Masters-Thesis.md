## Abstract

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects approximately 1% of the population, and seems to be largely genetic in origin.
A genetic diagnosis has the ability to improve treatment of those with ASD, but conventional methods have not been effective enough to make confident predictions from genetic data alone.
Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) data has been proven effective for understanding complex disease like the ASD.
In this thesis, we aim to analyze GWAS data sets using deep learning methods to better understand ASD.
However, in order to succeed with GWAS data, deep learning algorithms must overcome some issues common in such data sets: imbalanced phenotypes, high dimensionality, and the need for model interpretability.
To this end we introduce a novel algorithm, the Genetic Balancing Generative Adversarial Network (GBGAN) which addresses the issues.
GBGAN was tested as a phenotype predictor on a large data set obtained from the UK Biobank, and was compared alongside two other neural network models, and two more interpretable models.
Results show evidence in favor of the proposed GBGAN algorithm in terms of interpretability.
GBGAN outperformed other models in some metrics and appeared to address high dimensionality and class imbalance problems.
