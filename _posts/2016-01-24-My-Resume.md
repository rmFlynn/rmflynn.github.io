## Typography Elements in One

Let's start with a informative paragraph. **This text is bolded.** But not this one! _How about italic text?_ Cool right? Ok, let's **_combine_** them together. Yeah, that's right! I have code to highlight, so `ThisIsMyCode()`. What a nice! Good people will hyperlink away, so [here we go](#) or [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com).

## Blockquote

## List Items

1. First order list item
2. Second item

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses

## Code Blocks

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

## Horizontal Line

The HTML `<hr>` element is for creating a "thematic break" between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a `<hr>` with any of the following:

* `___`: three consecutive underscores
* `---`: three consecutive dashes
* `***`: three consecutive asterisks

renders to:

___
