## [C++ Data Command Line Explorer](https://github.com/rmFlynn/cpp_database_example)
This is an old example but it has been a long time since I authored a large C++
project, and I had fun with this assignment. I am more interested in rust for
new projects that need to be low level but I know I will be reading C and C++
and using it occasionally for a long time to come.

## [GTK3 in python example](https://github.com/rmFlynn/contagion_view_gtk)

At the start of the COVID19 pandemic i made this viewer to see the spread. It has A
simple ETL pipeline to format the data in feather files.
It was an experiment in interconnected data visualization, and a chance to work
with GTK to make a desktop app.

## [Bioelectric signals analysed with a variety of ML models](https://github.com/rmFlynn/cpp_database_example)

An example of using simple models for times series analyse and Label Propagation. Includes random
forest, SVN, and recurrent neural-networks.

**More coming soon**
