Welcome to my website! I intend to use this site to make my small contribution to the great database of knowledge that is the Internet. Here you'll find small projects I worked on, ideas I find interesting, or whatever else I want. My interest generally fall within computer science, math, statistics, and biotech. 


If I have something on this site that interests you, and you think there's something I can collaborate with you on, please check out my [resume](My-Resume) or contact me. You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rory-flynn-b752a0b0).


This website uses Jekyll, with a theme known as "the plain". It's by far the best Jekyll theme I've ever used. You can read more about it [here](http://heiswayi.github.io/the-plain.html).
