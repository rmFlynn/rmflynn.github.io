Welcome to my website! I intend to use this site to make my small contribution to the great database of knowledge that is the Internet. Here you'll find small projects I worked on, ideas I find interesting, or whatever else I want. My interest generally fall within computer science, math, statistics, and biotech. However like everyone else I'm also interested in space note that my favorite celestial body is the above icon. If I have something on this site that interests you, and you think there's something I can collaborate with you on please check out my resume or contact me. You can also connect with me on LinkedIn.


This website uses Jekyll with a theme known as the plane. It's by far the best Jeckle theme I've ever used. You can read more about it here [setid](http://heiswayi.github.io/the-plain.html).
